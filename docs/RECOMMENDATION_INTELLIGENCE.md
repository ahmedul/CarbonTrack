# Carbon Reduction Recommendations Intelligence System

## Overview

The CarbonTrack Recommendation Engine is an intelligent system that analyzes user behavior patterns and provides personalized carbon reduction suggestions based on scientific data and machine learning algorithms.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Pattern Analysis Engine**: Analyzes user emission data to identify behavior patterns
2. **Recommendation Scoring Algorithm**: Intelligently ranks suggestions based on relevance and impact
3. **Scientific Knowledge Base**: EPA, IPCC, DEFRA, IEA, and FAO emission factors
4. **Personalization Engine**: Tailors recommendations to individual user profiles

## Intelligence Algorithm Details

### 1. User Pattern Analysis

The system performs comprehensive analysis of user activities to understand:

#### Category Analysis
- **Dominant Categories**: Identifies which emission categories (transportation, energy, food, waste) contribute most to user's footprint
- **Distribution Patterns**: Determines if emissions are concentrated in one area or balanced across categories
- **Activity Frequency**: Tracks which specific activities are performed most often

#### Temporal Analysis
- **Monthly Trends**: Identifies seasonal patterns in user behavior
- **Activity Timing**: Understands when users are most active in different categories
- **Growth Patterns**: Detects increasing or decreasing emission trends

#### Impact Analysis
- **High-Impact Activities**: Identifies user's most carbon-intensive activities
- **Low-Hanging Fruit**: Finds easy opportunities for emission reductions
- **Total Footprint**: Calculates baseline emissions for impact comparison

### 2. Recommendation Scoring Algorithm

Each recommendation receives a relevance score (0-100) based on multiple factors:

#### Relevance Scoring (0-50 points)
```python
# Base score from potential CO‚ÇÇ savings
score = potential_savings_factor * 50

# Examples:
# 85% reduction potential = 42.5 points
# 30% reduction potential = 15 points
```

#### Implementation Feasibility (0-25 points)
- **Difficulty Level**:
  - Easy: +10 points
  - Medium: +5 points
  - Hard: +0 points
- **Timeframe**:
  - Immediate: +10 points
  - Short-term: +5 points
  - Long-term: +0 points
- **Cost**:
  - Free: +5 points
  - Low cost: +3 points
  - Medium/High cost: +0 points

#### User Activity Matching (0-25 points)
- **Activity Triggers**: Recommendations only appear if user performs relevant activities
- **Category Relevance**: Higher scores for recommendations in user's dominant emission categories
- **Frequency Bonus**: Extra points for recommendations targeting frequent user activities

### 3. Scientific Knowledge Base

#### Emission Factors Integration
The system uses scientifically-validated emission factors:

- **EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)**: US-specific factors
- **IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)**: Global standards
- **DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs)**: UK methodology
- **IEA (International Energy Agency)**: Energy-specific factors
- **FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)**: Food production factors

#### Impact Calculations
```python
# Example: Transportation recommendation
user_annual_driving = 15000  # km per year
current_car_emissions = 0.192  # kg CO‚ÇÇ/km (medium gasoline car)
hybrid_car_emissions = 0.109  # kg CO‚ÇÇ/km

annual_savings = user_annual_driving * (current_car_emissions - hybrid_car_emissions)
# Result: 1,245 kg CO‚ÇÇ saved per year
```
