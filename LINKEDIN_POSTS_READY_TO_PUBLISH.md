Why I Built CarbonTrack: A Founder's Story 🌍

2 years ago, I was consulting for a mid-size German manufacturer.

The sustainability manager showed me their "carbon tracking system":
→ 47 Excel spreadsheets
→ 6 different departments
→ 200+ hours per quarter
→ Constant errors

When CSRD was announced, they panicked.

I thought: "There has to be a better way."

So I built CarbonTrack.

🎯 THE MISSION:
Make sustainability reporting accessible to EVERY company, not just Fortune 500s.

💡 THE INSIGHT:
SMEs don't need complexity. They need:
✓ Simple tools
✓ Clear guidance
✓ Affordable pricing
✓ Fast results

🛠️ THE BUILD:
• 6 months of development
• 50+ user interviews
• 3 complete rewrites
• 1,000+ hours of coding

🚀 THE LAUNCH:
Today, CarbonTrack helps 100+ companies stay compliant.

But this is just the beginning.

📅 THE VISION:
By 2027, I want CarbonTrack to be the #1 sustainability platform for SMEs in Europe.

Every company should be able to:
→ Track emissions effortlessly
→ Comply with regulations easily
