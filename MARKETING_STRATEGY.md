Subject: CSRD deadline: 60 days to compliance 🚨

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is likely subject to EU CSRD reporting requirements starting January 2026.

Non-compliance = €50,000+ fines.

Most companies I talk to are still using Excel. There's a better (and cheaper) way.

CarbonTrack automates:
✅ Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions tracking
✅ ESRS-compliant report generation  
✅ Audit trail documentation
✅ Third-party auditor integration

90% cheaper than SAP/Salesforce. Takes 10 minutes to set up.

Worth a 15-minute demo?

I'm offering 10 free CSRD compliance audits to EU SMEs this month.

What you get:
✅ Gap analysis of your current emissions data
✅ Compliance score (0-100%)
✅ Actionable recommendations
✅ Estimated implementation timeline

No strings attached. Just want to help companies avoid fines.

Interested? Reply "YES" and I'll send the audit form.

Best,
Ahmed

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't post generic "We're hiring!" or "Happy Friday!" content**
→ Adds no value. People scroll past.

❌ **Don't over-automate LinkedIn**
→ You'll get shadowbanned. Be authentic.

❌ **Don't launch on Product Hunt on Friday**
→ Weekends get 70% less traffic.

❌ **Don't spam subreddits with product links**
→ You'll get banned. Engage first, promote second.

❌ **Don't use jargon in marketing**
→ "ESRS E1 Climate Change mitigation through GHG Protocol Scope 1-3 quantification"
→ Use simple language: "Track your carbon emissions. Stay compliant."

❌ **Don't ignore negative feedback**
→ Respond professionally. Turn critics into fans.
