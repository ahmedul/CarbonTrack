**Why Tracking Your Carbon Footprint Matters (And How to Actually Do It)**

Did you know the average person produces 4+ tons of CO2 annually? 🌍

But here's the problem: **We can't manage what we don't measure.**

**Why Carbon Tracking Matters:**

1️⃣ **Awareness Creates Change**
Studies show people reduce emissions by 15-20% simply by tracking them. Why? Because you discover your biggest impact areas.

2️⃣ **Small Actions, Big Impact**
• Carpooling 2x/week = -520 kg CO2/year
• Plant-based meals 3x/week = -340 kg CO2/year  
• Switching to LED bulbs = -180 kg CO2/year

3️⃣ **Corporate Accountability**
64% of consumers prefer brands committed to reducing their footprint. Companies need tools to measure and report ESG metrics.

4️⃣ **The 2°C Goal**
To limit global warming to 1.5-2°C, we need to cut emissions 45% by 2030. Every ton matters.

**The Challenge:** Most carbon calculators are:
❌ One-time calculations (not continuous tracking)
❌ Generic (don't personalize to your lifestyle)
❌ Boring (no motivation to keep using them)

**The Solution:** CarbonTrack

I built this to make carbon tracking:
✅ **Easy** - Log activities in 30 seconds
✅ **Visual** - See your impact with charts
✅ **Actionable** - Get personalized tips
✅ **Motivating** - Gamification & progress tracking

**📹 Watch the video below** to see how it works in 60 seconds!

**How You Can Start:**
👉 Try the app (test credentials on the login page)
👉 Track for 1 week to find your baseline
👉 Pick ONE area to improve this month
👉 Measure your progress

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of good.** Start small. Track honestly. Improve gradually.
