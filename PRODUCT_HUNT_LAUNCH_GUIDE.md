## 🎬 FIRST COMMENT (Post Immediately After Launch)

**This is CRUCIAL - Post this as first comment within 1 minute of launch:**

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Ahmed, founder of CarbonTrack. Super excited to launch here today!

🎯 **THE PROBLEM:**

50,000+ EU companies must report carbon emissions by January 2026 (CSRD regulation). But:

❌ Most SMEs use Excel spreadsheets (200+ hours per quarter)
❌ Enterprise solutions cost €5K+/month
❌ Consultants charge €15K-25K per project
❌ Non-compliance = €50K+ fines

SMEs are stuck between regulatory requirements and unaffordable solutions.

💡 **THE SOLUTION:**

CarbonTrack makes sustainability reporting accessible:

✅ **Affordable:** €49/month (not €5K+)
✅ **Fast:** Setup in 5 minutes (not 6 months)
✅ **Simple:** No consultants needed
✅ **Complete:** 7 ESRS standards + audit trail

**Key Features:**
• Automated Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions tracking
• One-click CSRD compliance reports
• Built-in ESRS standards (E1-E5, S1, G1)
• Team collaboration & permissions
• Audit trail for regulatory compliance
• PDF export ready for submission

🛠️ **THE TECH:**

Built on AWS serverless (Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito). Vue.js 3 frontend. Scales to zero when not in use. 99.99% uptime. GDPR compliant (EU-Central-1 region).

📊 **EARLY TRACTION:**

Soft launched 7 days ago:
• 127 signups
• 18 active companies
• 847 kg CO2 tracked
• 92% user satisfaction

🎁 **PRODUCT HUNT EXCLUSIVE:**

Use code **PRODUCTHUNT** for:
• 3 months FREE on Professional plan
• Priority onboarding
• Direct access to me for support

🙏 **WHY I BUILT THIS:**

I consulted for a manufacturer using 47 Excel spreadsheets for carbon tracking. When CSRD was announced, they panicked. I realized SMEs need tools built FOR them, not enterprise software they can't afford or use.

❓ **QUESTIONS?**

Happy to answer anything about:
• CSRD compliance
• Carbon tracking methodologies
• Our tech stack
• Sustainability reporting
• Building climate tech

Thank you for your support! 🌍🚀

## 💬 RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### For Questions:

**Q: "How is this different from [competitor]?"**
```
Great question! Key differences:

1. Price: €49/mo vs €5K+/mo
2. Target: Built for SMEs, not enterprises
3. Setup: 5 minutes vs 6 months
4. CSRD: Native ESRS compliance included

We focus on making it accessible, not feature-bloated.

Want a detailed comparison? Happy to share!
```

**Q: "What about Scope 3 emissions?"**
```
Yes! CarbonTrack includes Scope 3:

• Business travel
• Employee commuting
• Upstream suppliers
• Downstream customers
• Product lifecycle

We have 50+ pre-built calculators. You can also add custom emission factors.

```
Currently focused on EU CSRD, which covers 27 member states.

In fact, [explain current workaround or ETA].

We also have a free tier for personal use.

## 🚫 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Not responding fast enough** - Reply within 15 min
2. **Being too salesy** - Be helpful, not pushy
3. **Ignoring negative feedback** - Address concerns openly
4. **Launching on wrong day** - Avoid Mon, Fri, holidays
5. **No first comment** - Must post within 1 minute
6. **Poor visuals** - Invest time in screenshots/video

8. **Not preparing supporters** - Tell people in advance
9. **Giving up too early** - Stay engaged all 24 hours
