# LinkedIn Post: Landing Page Launch

## Post 1: Product Launch Announcement

---

🚀 **Excited to share: CarbonTrack's new professional website is live!**

After months of development, we've launched a comprehensive landing page that showcases how CarbonTrack helps businesses navigate the complex world of carbon emissions tracking and CSRD compliance.

🌍 **What's New:**
• Professional landing page at carbontracksystem.com
• Clear CSRD compliance information for 50,000+ affected EU companies
• Transparent pricing (Free → €449/month)
• Honest product roadmap showing our MVP status
• 85-95% cost savings vs. traditional consulting

⚠️ **Why This Matters:**
The EU CSRD directive is requiring companies to report on 12 ESRS standards starting 2025 (for 2024 data). Penalties for non-compliance can reach up to 5% of annual turnover.

Traditional solutions cost €100K-350K over 3 years. CarbonTrack provides the same professional compliance tools for €13,470 over 3 years.

🎯 **What We're Building:**
✅ Core carbon tracking (Live now)
✅ AI-powered recommendations (Live now)
✅ Multi-user collaboration (Live now)
🚧 CSRD Compliance Module (Launching Q1 2026 - 90% complete)

We're building in public and being transparent about our MVP journey. Early adopters get grandfathered pricing when we launch the CSRD module in January 2026.

## Post 2: Behind the Scenes (Personal Story)

**Building in public: Our journey from MVP to professional CSRD platform** 🌱

Three months ago, CarbonTrack was a simple carbon tracking tool. Today, we're launching a professional landing page positioning us as a CSRD compliance solution.

Here's what I learned building this in the open:

1️⃣ **Transparency wins trust**
Instead of hiding that we're an MVP, we put it front and center. "90% backend complete, frontend in development." Honest roadmap. Real timelines.

2️⃣ **Price transparency is powerful**
We show exact comparisons: €13K vs €110K-350K (traditional consultants). No "contact sales" gatekeeping. B2B buyers appreciate clarity.

3️⃣ **CSRD urgency is real**
50,000+ companies must comply. First reports due 2025. Penalties up to 5% turnover. The market needs accessible solutions NOW.

4️⃣ **Technical excellence matters**
Our backend is 90% done: 19 API endpoints, DynamoDB tables, audit trails, ESRS templates. We're not promising vapor - we're shipping.

**What's next:**
• Q1 2026: Launch CSRD Compliance Module
• Beta access for Professional subscribers (December 2025)
• Full ESRS E1-E5 standards support
• XBRL export, third-party verification

The landing page took 2 days to build. The CSRD module has taken 3 months (and counting). That's startup reality.

If you're building climate tech, compliance tools, or any B2B SaaS - here's my advice:
→ Ship the landing page before the product is perfect
→ Be honest about what works and what's coming
→ Show your pricing (seriously)
→ Build for a real deadline (CSRD is ours)

## Post 3: Educational Content (CSRD Explainer)

**What is CSRD? A simple explainer for the 50,000+ companies that must comply** 📊

If you're running a European company with 250+ employees, €40M+ turnover, or €20M+ balance sheet - this affects you.

**The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requires:**

🌍 **Environmental reporting (E1-E5):**
• Climate change (Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions)
• Pollution
• Water & marine resources
• Biodiversity
• Circular economy

👥 **Social reporting (S1-S4):**
• Workforce conditions
• Value chain workers
• Affected communities
• Consumers & end-users

⚖️ **Governance (G1):**
• Business conduct
• Ethics & anti-corruption

**Timeline:**
✅ 2024: Directive in force
⏰ 2025: First reports due (for 2024 data)
📅 2026: Listed SMEs start reporting
🌐 2028: Non-EU companies with EU operations

**The Problem:**
Traditional compliance solutions cost:
• €20K-50K initial setup
• €30K-100K annual fees
• 6-18 months to implement
• Requires consultants for every change

**Why we built CarbonTrack:**
We're making CSRD compliance accessible:
• €149/month (Professional tier)
• 1-day setup time
• Self-service platform
• 85-95% cost savings

Our CSRD module launches Q1 2026, but you can start tracking emissions today for free.
