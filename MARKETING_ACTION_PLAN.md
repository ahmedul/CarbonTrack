## 🚨 RED FLAGS TO WATCH

**If by Week 2 you see:**
- ❌ <10 signups → Messaging problem, adjust copy
- ❌ <100 website visits → Distribution problem, post more
- ❌ <1% conversion → Product problem, talk to users
- ❌ <50% activation → Onboarding problem, simplify
- ❌ 0 paying customers → Pricing problem, validate willingness to pay

**Action Items:**
1. Interview 5 users who didn't convert
2. Ask: "What stopped you from signing up/paying?"
3. Adjust strategy based on feedback
4. Iterate quickly (48-hour cycles)
