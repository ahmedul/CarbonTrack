## The CSRD Challenge

### Why This Matters Now

Starting **January 1, 2024**, the **EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)** fundamentally changes how companies report environmental impact:

#### Who Must Comply?

- **Large EU Companies:** 250+ employees, €40M+ turnover, or €20M+ balance sheet
- **Listed SMEs:** Companies listed on EU-regulated markets (from 2026)
- **Non-EU Companies:** With €150M+ EU revenue and EU subsidiary (from 2028)

**Estimated Impact:** 50,000+ companies across Europe must comply

#### What's Required?

The CSRD mandates reporting across **12 European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)**:

**Environmental Standards (E1-E5):**
- E1: Climate Change (Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions)
- E2: Pollution
- E3: Water & Marine Resources
- E4: Biodiversity & Ecosystems
- E5: Resource Use & Circular Economy

**Social Standards (S1-S4):**
- S1: Own Workforce
- S2: Workers in Value Chain
- S3: Affected Communities
- S4: Consumers & End-users

**Governance Standards (G1):**
- G1: Business Conduct

#### Penalties for Non-Compliance

- **Financial Sanctions:** Up to 5% of annual turnover
- **Audit Failures:** Third-party verification rejections
- **Reputational Damage:** Public disclosure of non-compliance
- **Market Access:** Restricted access to sustainable finance

**The Clock Is Ticking:** First reports due 2025 for fiscal year 2024 data
