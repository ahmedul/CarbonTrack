Thread on why I built this 👇
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
2/ The problem: 50,000+ EU companies must report carbon emissions by Jan 2026 (CSRD regulation)

Most SMEs are using Excel spreadsheets. 😰

Takes 200+ hours per quarter.
Errors everywhere.
Non-compliance = €50K+ fines.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
3/ Enterprise solutions exist (SAP, Oracle) but:

❌ Cost €5K+/month
❌ Take 6 months to implement  
❌ Require consultants
❌ Built for Fortune 500, not SMEs

SMEs need something different.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
4/ So I built CarbonTrack:

✅ €49/month (not €5K)
✅ Setup in 5 minutes (not 6 months)
✅ No consultants needed
✅ Made for SMEs

Automated ESRS reporting. One-click compliance. Audit trail included.
```

Deploys in <5 min.
Scales to zero.
99.99% uptime.
