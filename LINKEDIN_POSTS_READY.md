🚨 EU CSRD Compliance Alert: 60 Days to Deadline

Starting January 2026, over 50,000 EU companies MUST report their carbon emissions.

The penalty for non-compliance? 

→ €50,000+ in fines
→ Reputational damage
→ Investor scrutiny

Yet, 73% of SMEs still track carbon data in Excel spreadsheets.

The problem? 

Enterprise sustainability software costs €50,000-€200,000 per year. Most SMEs simply can't afford it.

There's a better way. 👇

CarbonTrack brings enterprise-grade carbon tracking to SMEs for €49/month.

✅ Automated Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions tracking
✅ ESRS-compliant reporting in minutes
✅ Real-time compliance dashboard
✅ Third-party auditor integration

90% cheaper. 100% compliant.

### **POST 2: Solution Introduction (Post 2 Days Later)**

```
🌍 Introducing CarbonTrack

The carbon tracking platform built for SMEs, not enterprises.

After talking to 50+ sustainability managers, we learned:

❌ Enterprise tools are too expensive (€50K-200K/year)
❌ Excel spreadsheets are error-prone and time-consuming
❌ CSRD deadline is causing panic
❌ Most consultants charge €10K+ just for setup

So we built something different:

✅ Set up in 10 minutes (not 6 months)
✅ Automated ESRS reporting (no manual data entry)
✅ Real-time emissions tracking (not quarterly reports)
✅ €49/month (not €50,000/year)

Built on AWS serverless architecture. Scales from 1 to 10,000 users.

We believe sustainability reporting should be accessible to every business, not just Fortune 500 companies.

Currently live with 14+ companies tracking 500+ kg CO₂.

### **POST 3: Founder Story (Post 5 Days Later)**

```
Why I Built CarbonTrack 🌱

6 months ago, I was consulting for a German manufacturing SME.

They asked: "How do we comply with CSRD without spending €100K?"

I said: "You can't. All the tools are enterprise-focused."

Their response: "Then we'll get fined. We have no choice."

That conversation kept me up at night.

50,000+ European SMEs face the same problem:
→ CSRD compliance is mandatory
→ Enterprise tools are unaffordable
→ Fines start at €50,000
→ Deadlines are imminent

So I spent 6 months building CarbonTrack.

Full-stack AWS serverless platform.
Python FastAPI backend.
Vue.js frontend.
DynamoDB for scale.

Total monthly cost: €4-6 (for infrastructure).
Pricing: €49/month (90% cheaper than SAP/Salesforce).

Today, CarbonTrack is live: https://carbontracksystem.com

✅ Automated carbon tracking
✅ ESRS-compliant reporting
✅ Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions
✅ Audit trail for compliance
✅ Third-party integration ready

The mission: Make sustainability reporting accessible to EVERY business.

Not just the ones with €100K budgets.

📊 What is CSRD? A 2-Minute Breakdown

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is the EU's new mandatory carbon reporting law.

WHO MUST COMPLY?
→ Large companies (500+ employees)
→ Listed SMEs
→ Non-EU companies with €150M+ EU revenue

DEADLINE: January 1, 2026 (58 days away!)

WHAT YOU MUST REPORT:
✅ Scope 1 emissions (direct, e.g., company vehicles)
✅ Scope 2 emissions (indirect, e.g., purchased electricity)  
✅ Scope 3 emissions (value chain, e.g., supplier emissions)
✅ ESRS metrics (European Sustainability Reporting Standards)

PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE:
→ €50,000-€100,000 fines (varies by country)
→ Reputational damage
→ Investor pressure
→ Exclusion from public tenders

THE GOOD NEWS:
You don't need €100K to comply.

CarbonTrack automates the entire process for €49/month:
→ Track emissions across all scopes
→ Generate ESRS-compliant reports
→ Real-time compliance dashboard
→ Export for auditors
